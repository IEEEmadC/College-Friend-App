# Project description
## Problem detected
At the time of graduating from middle school, choosing which university to continue your studies becomes a problem when:  

 - You do not have information about the professional careers that are offered or each time the registrations are opened.  
 - You do not know the qualities of the universities near you, such as economic and transportation support, sports or cultural activities, and even more important, what is their academic level and what graduate profiles they promise.  
 - You have very specific interests in certain areas of knowledge and you are looking for the best preparation with highly trained teachers.  
 - The budget for your education is somewhat cut.

## Solution to the problem
College Friend App seeks to create an active community of people who share information and experiences in the form of texts and images so that pre-university students can have elements that serve as support to select the university that most closely matches their expectations. The application will have artificial intelligence help to filter the opinions of users, thus avoiding the dissemination of false information and inappropriate content. All users must go through a register, this will serve to recommend universities that already have opinions and that are within an acceptable distance or to start talking about a certain university. Users who review a certain university generate a history, this will serve to evaluate more accurately if the information published corresponds to a normal user or if it is an anomaly and can interact directly with the integrated chat. All opinions may be qualified as useful, not useful or reported for analysis. The personnel of the universities will not have interference on the score or opinions published, either for or against, this in order to provide information from a student-to-student perspective.
